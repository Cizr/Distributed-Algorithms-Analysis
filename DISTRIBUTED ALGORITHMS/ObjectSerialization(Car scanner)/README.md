# Explanation:
Serialization: Converting an object into a byte stream to send it over the network or to save it to a file.
Deserialization: Converting the byte stream back into an object.

# Serializing an Object:
Obtain the output stream from the socket to send data to the client.
Create an ObjectOutputStream from the output stream.
Create an instance of the object you want to serialize (e.g., car).
Write the object to the ObjectOutputStream using the writeObject() method.

# Deserializing an Object:
Obtain the input stream from the socket to receive data from the client.
Create an ObjectInputStream from the input stream.
Read the object from the ObjectInputStream using the readObject() method.
Cast the read object to the appropriate type (e.g., car).
